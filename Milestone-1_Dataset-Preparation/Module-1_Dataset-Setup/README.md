## Module 1: Dataset Setup and Image Labeling

### Objective
To create, label, and prepare a facial skin dataset for classification.

### Dataset Creation
- The dataset was **created by web scraping facial images** from publicly available sources.
- Images were collected carefully to represent different facial skin conditions.

### Classes Defined
- Wrinkles
- Dark Spots
- Puffy Eyes
- Clear Skin

### Dataset Preparation Steps
- Scraped images were manually inspected.
- Irrelevant, duplicate, and low-quality images were removed.
- Images were categorized into class-wise folders.
- Class distribution was balanced to reduce bias.

### Deliverables
- Custom-created and labeled dataset
- Class distribution visualization
- Dataset folder structure documentation

### Note
The dataset is not uploaded to GitHub due to size constraints.
Only sample images and structure details are provided.
