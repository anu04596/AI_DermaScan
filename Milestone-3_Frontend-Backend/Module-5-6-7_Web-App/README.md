## Modules 5, 6 & 7: Web UI, Backend Inference and Export

### Objective
To build an end-to-end application for facial skin analysis.

### Module 5: Web UI
- Developed using Streamlit
- Image upload and preview functionality
- Displays predictions and bounding boxes

### Module 6: Backend Inference
- Modularized preprocessing and inference pipeline
- EfficientNet model loaded for prediction
- Prediction results returned to UI

### Module 7: Export and Logging
- Option to download annotated images
- CSV export for predictions
- Logging of inference results

### Reason for Integration
These modules are combined to ensure a seamless and efficient end-to-end pipeline.

### Outcome
Smooth UI interaction with inference time under acceptable limits.
